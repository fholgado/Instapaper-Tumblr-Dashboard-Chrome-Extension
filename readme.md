# Instapaper Tumblr Dashboard Extension for Google Chrome #

This is an extension I created to quickly save long posts that I come across in my Tumblr Dashboard without having to go to the actual post and use the Instapaper bookmarklet.

I also created this extension to learn a bit about how a Chrome extension is put together. Turns out, it's rather simple! This extension uses jQuery to do it's function, so it's a great starting point for other developers looking to do some cool jQuery stuff in an extension.
